Hello this is a test

The official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of prose classes you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you donâ€™t control, like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS.

<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">{{ markdown }}</article>
To see what it looks like in action, check out our live demo on Tailwind Play.

Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
Then add the plugin to your main style.css file:

  @import "tailwindcss";
+ @plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
If you are still using Tailwind CSS v3, add the plugin to your tailwind.config.js file:

// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
Basic usage

Now you can use the prose classes to add sensible typography styles to any vanilla HTML:

<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.

Choosing a gray scale

This plugin includes a modifier class for each of the five gray scales Tailwind includes by default so you can easily style your content to match the grays you're using in your project.

<article class="prose prose-slate">{{ markdown }}</article>
Here are the classes that are generated using a totally default Tailwind CSS v2.0 build:
