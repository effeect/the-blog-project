          If you have stumbled onto this website, thank you very much as this is
          just a quick and easy way for me to convey and share potential ideas
          for projects and general thoughts about technology, gaming and other
          things I’m passionate about.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          In terms of who I am, I’m Oliver Dimes. 26-year-old person who is
          quite passionate about the world of gaming and technology and have
          been for a very long time. I specialise mostly in writing software
          stuff, specifically in the realm of Python/JavaScript full stack and
          I’ve been spending some time expanding my knowledge of both. For
          example, this very site is built on Next.JS and it works pretty well
          for me so far.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If you need to contact me for whatever reason (one of my projects is
          broken or you have a query), contact me via Bluesky or you can find my
          contact info on Github/LinkedIn if you need something a bit more
          concrete. Many Thanks, Let’s go!
